But when trying to access `num_2 = 222`and then print the same variable from outside the function ie print(num_2), it raised a NameError.

    "> - The main difference between pass by value and pass by reference is that, in a pass by value, the parameter value copies to another variable while, in a pass by reference, the actual parameter passes to the function.\n",
    ">- When we define a custom or user defined function in Python we may, optionally we may need to specify parameter names between the function’s parentheses.\n",
    ">- If we specify parameters in the function definition, then we need to pass argument values to the function’s parameters while calling it.\n",
    ">- The function use that passed values during its execution by referencing it via parameter name.\n",
    ">- The `Callee` is a function called by another and the `caller` is a function that calls another function (the callee).\n",
    "            The values that are passed in the function call are called the actual parameters.\n",
    "            The values received by the function (when it is called ) are called the formal parameters.\n",
    ">- Basically, there are two ways to pass argument values to the function’s parameters. They are:\n",
    "            i) Call/Pass by Value\n",
    "            ii) Call/Pass by Reference\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **`i) Pass by Value:`**\n",
    ">- In pass by value (also known as call by value), the argument passed to the function is the copy of of its original object. If we change or update the value of object inside the function, then original object will not change.\n",
    ">- If the argument is variable, the copy of the current value of the variable is passed to the function’s parameter. The value of the variable in the function call is not affected by what happens inside the function.\n",
    ">- Some of the programming languages like C++, Java uses call by value or pass by value concept to pass argument values to the function’s parameters.\n",
    ">- If the argument is passed by value, a copy of it is made and passed to the function. If the argument values being passed to the function is large, the copying can take up a lot of time and memory.\n",
    ">- That’s why `Python language does not support the pass by value` concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **`ii) Pass by Reference:`**\n",
    ">- In pass by reference (also known as call by reference), the argument passed to the function’s parameter is the original object. If we change the value of object inside the function, the original object will also change.\n",
    ">- The scripting language like JavaScript uses the pass by reference mechanism to pass an object as an argument to the function. \n",
